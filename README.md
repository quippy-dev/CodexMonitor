# CodexMonitor

![CodexMonitor](screenshot.png)

CodexMonitor is a macOS Tauri app for orchestrating multiple Codex agents across local workspaces. It provides a sidebar to manage projects, a home screen for quick actions, and a conversation view backed by the Codex app-server protocol.

## Features (MVP)

- Add and persist workspaces using the system folder picker.
- Spawn one `codex app-server` per workspace and stream events over JSON-RPC.
- Restore threads per workspace from the Codex rollout history (`thread/list`) and resume on selection.
- Start agent threads, send messages, show reasoning/tool call items, and handle approvals.
- Worktree agents per workspace (create/delete git worktrees under `.codex-worktrees`).
- Git panel with diff stats, file diffs, and commit log; open commits on GitHub when a remote is detected.
- Branch list with checkout and create flows.
- Model picker, reasoning effort selector, access mode (read-only/current/full-access), and context usage ring.
- Skills menu and composer autocomplete for `$skill` and `@file` tokens.
- Plan panel for per-turn planning updates and turn interruption controls.
- Review runs against uncommitted changes, base branch, commits, or custom instructions.
- Debug panel for warning/error events and clipboard export.
- Sidebar usage + credits meter for account rate limits.
- Archive threads (removes from UI and calls `thread/archive`).
- macOS overlay title bar with vibrancy effects.

## Requirements

- Node.js + npm
- Rust toolchain (stable)
- Codex installed on your system and available as `codex` in `PATH`
- Git CLI (used for worktree operations)

If the `codex` binary is not in `PATH`, update the backend to pass a custom path per workspace.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run in dev mode:

```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

## Release Build

Build the production Tauri bundle (app + dmg):

```bash
npm run tauri build
```

The macOS app bundle will be in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos/`.

## Type Checking

Run the TypeScript checker (no emit):

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

Note: `npm run build` also runs `tsc` before bundling the frontend.

## Notes

- Workspaces persist to `workspaces.json` under the app data directory.
- On launch and on window focus, the app reconnects and refreshes thread lists for each workspace.
- Threads are restored by filtering `thread/list` results using the workspace `cwd`.
- Selecting a thread always calls `thread/resume` to refresh messages from disk.
- CLI sessions appear if their `cwd` matches the workspace path; they are not live-streamed unless resumed.
- The app uses `codex app-server` over stdio; see `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`.
- Worktree agents live in `.codex-worktrees/` and are removed on delete; the root repo gets a `.gitignore` entry.

## Tauri IPC Surface

Frontend calls live in `src/services/tauri.ts` and map to commands in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`. Core commands include:

- Workspace lifecycle: `list_workspaces`, `add_workspace`, `add_worktree`, `remove_workspace`, `remove_worktree`, `connect_workspace`, `update_workspace_settings`.
- Threads: `start_thread`, `list_threads`, `resume_thread`, `archive_thread`, `send_user_message`, `turn_interrupt`, `respond_to_server_request`.
- Reviews + models: `start_review`, `model_list`, `account_rate_limits`, `skills_list`.
- Git + files: `get_git_status`, `get_git_diffs`, `get_git_log`, `get_git_remote`, `list_git_branches`, `checkout_git_branch`, `create_git_branch`, `list_workspace_files`.
